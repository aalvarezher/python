I chose to delete Peacock before I turned that tv off... now I have to go buy a new fire stick,,, do what you want but I wouldn't,,, p.s.  the peacock content looked really good though from the half hour of my visit but killing your fire stick wasn't worth it in my opinion.

  This apps inability to remember a save point during a live event like the super bowl caused me to miss the entirety of the 4th quarter. If your streaming service cannot retain replay rights for an event that grandiose for up to one hour after event end, perhaps you should get out of the steaming service. Some ppl need to pause these thing, and to have play back abilities removed is a horrifying realization after shaking a screen awake after a minute of sleep.I will never use peacock again. other than being a cable giant that has contracts for major events,they being nothing to the table

    Buggy App
  
","









  
  
    
  The app has a lot of lag. You can open it and it takes nearly 30 seconds to load. It's not a network issue, because other apps are fast to load. It also has a bug related to going to the screensaver. If you walk away after pausing the app, and it goes to the screensaver, the whole stick has to be unplugged and started again, as the remote is unresponsive. Again, it's only in this app that the fire stick becomes unresponsive. We also get occasional (maybe 3-4 times a week) warnings our bluetooth remote needs to be paired when using Peacock. But never have gotten that message in Netflix, Hulu, Prime, etc. So it's again a bug in the Peacock app. I've reported that, and been told it's not big bugs, so Peacock isn't interested in bug reports. It works, it's just a pain to have to work around their obvious bugs.

  UPDATED: 10-08-2021:  They EARN 5 STARS for FREE and we'll see for what I am paying for. We have ""Peacocked"" for about a year, free. Now, I'll be buying the ANNUAL $49.99 streaming service, instead of the $4.99 per month subscription.I have to agree that the free version does seem to pay with the volume settings, randomly;  Hopefully the Premium doesn't, else I'll likely not renew. I don't mind watching commercials:  I'm a computer-savvy sixty-PLUS individual, so I won't go to the ""Commecial Free"" / ""Downloadable"" Super-Version.For some reason, the FireStick-Peacock app (free) doesn't often disconnect (IMPROVED!), like Paramount app (paid) does, but both will send you to your TV set / Amazon Device HOMESCREEN and might actually turn off your device.We find it odd that some ""Law & Order"" and ""CSI"" series are to be found on each, but... Great!Since Peacock is NBC and Paramount is carrying CBS We get some of the best entertainment, commercials and all. That might allow us to delete a good CABLE-CUTTERS option (Philo $20 per month Subscription).

  Was forced to switch to Peacock when they absorbed the WWE Network.  Yes, my monthly bill went down, but so did the overall quality of the service.  Yes I had more content, but I could search for a 'featured' program (it was literally one of the slides on their front page) and it wouldn't show it as existing.  They don't have a live pause button, that's a common feature of many streaming services and your local cable provider.  The quality (picture/sound) has gone downhill drastically.  The feed often becomes grainy during live events.  Yes, I know that there are MANY things that could contribute to this but it seems to happen every event I watch since Peacock took over as the platform.  The overall user interface feels like a grad student in web design made it for a school project.  I've considered buying a VPN just to use the WWE Network in England.  The extra cost might be worth the alleviation of the suffering Peacock causes me every time I try and use it.

  The stream sticks. In order to watch shows that's suppose to be free, and you still asking for money.  People shouldn't have to pay to watch something that you claim is free

  I signed up for one program. When I read that there is a maximum number of hours for watching free. After that $39.95.  One must be careful not to reach the limit, or they stick it to you. Luckily, I found the program I liked on another service, which is FREE!I also resent the advertising push to watch more and more programs! - When are going to work? Even if you are retired, you have more useful activities than to watch video, that does not enhance anything in your life. Imagine what would happen, if everybody were to watch ""stupid' videos, and do nothing else.

  The continent on here is vast. The streaming quality is excellent I am using a wireless router in a large oversized home and I am very far from my router and I am just blown away by the quality of the stream on this channel. I am comparing this primarily to Paramount plus which I have had since they started the Netwerk when it was called the CBS app and in comparison this is way better than Paramount plus. There is a vast amount of new and vintage content. We are really enjoying some of the vintage shows on this app the quality is better than other channels that have offered these programs.  I give the peacock channel very high marks
