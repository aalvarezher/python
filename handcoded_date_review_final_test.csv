    Peacock is great for Olympics but not much else
  
","









  
  
    
  We bought the plus WITH commercials thinking it would be like normal broadcast TV commercials but it is not 150 seconds per break with last 60 seconds interrupting sporting events.  Totally not desirable and it's the same commercials each time, you begin to actually hate the products.  When nbc mess's up you see a black screen saying will be back shortly when there should have been a commercial.  Do not order peacock with commercials instead order peacock plus ad free.  It's the only version doable.  It is not totally ad free you get some 30 second commercials at random times even during the action.  Probably the control room not paying attention.  It really does feel like amateur hour with replays being right above highlights of the same event so it's possible to see in the headlines who won before you watch it.  But on a positive note the replays are fantastic much better than cobbled together nbc primetime where it's you get what they think you want.  Also the replays tend to have far less drama and no politics.  Amazon allowed us to change our subscription to ad free which is the way to go.  We will be cancelling subscription after Olympics, we could not find anything else to watch.  Very limited content.

    Takes FOREVER to load every show!
  
","









  
  
    
  We have had Peacock for 4 months bc Amazon Prime decided to take off 2 of my favorite shows. Why Amazon Prime? But, every time we select the show or to go to the app itself, it would literally take almost an entire minute to load. And then it wouldn't load the specific show but would go to the list of shows & seasons. Then after every show you would wait & wait until it would take you all the way back to the seasons list again. It's supposed to go right to the next show after one plays. Nope, unless you're lucky one day. Every other channel I have on Prime starts & works perfectly fine, so it's not my internet.  Canceled today bc I'm not paying $10.99 for a channel I can't even watch!

  Downloaded this app to watch 2020(1) Olympics.  All the advertising on NBC indicated that additional events would be broadcast on Peacock.  Events on Peacock were not live, but delayed by more than a day in most cases for events I wanted to see live.  Actually, live shows mostly required authorization with some other outrageously priced 3rd party service subscription.  This app is worse than useless.
